https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences/description/

You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), 
you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers.
Return whether you can make such a split.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences :
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences :
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5
Example 3:
